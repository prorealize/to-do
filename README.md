# To Do Application

This is a simple to do application that allows users to create, read, update and delete tasks.
It uses go as the backend language and Rust for a notification server.

The idea here is to demonstrate skills in both languages and in scaling applications.

What to do next
- Logging / Tracing
- Error Handler
- Authentication
